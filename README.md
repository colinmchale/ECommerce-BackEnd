# E-Commerce Back-End

## Description  
This application was created to pull information from, create, update and delete rows in several tables using back-end technology. The tables are conatined in a database we create and populate using our schema.sql and seeds folder inside of the repo. Once their is some information inside of our tables we are able to start using the routes folder and request methods inside of them to interact with the tables.

## Installation  
The project's dependencies are already inside of the repo in package.json. The user, once the repo has been opened, will have to run "npm i" in the terminal to install the necessary packages. This application utilizes sequelize, mysql2, dotenv, and express.

## Usage  
To begin the program the user must first initialize the server by running the command "node server.js" in the terminal. Once the server has begun, the user will need to open an Insomnia window to investigate the routes created in the routes folder of the repo. Depending on the user's desired action, a GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE can all be ran through Insomnia. The resulting table can be checked in MySQL workbench.
